# Workaround for issue on i.MX RT10xx (camera => CSI) where the CSI driver
# needs to be initialized before the camera sensor, so that it can provide
# clock for the camera. On i.MX RT11xx (camera => MIPI CSI2Rx => CSI), we
# don't have this issue. However, since the CSI is common for both platforms,
# it also implies that the CSI needs to be initialized before MIPI CSI2Rx too.
