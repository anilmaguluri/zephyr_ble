menuconfig CLOCK_MGMT
	bool "Clock management drivers"
	help
	  Enable support for clock management drivers. These drivers provide
	  clock configuration to the system via a series of setpoints, which
	  allow drivers to configure clocks based on their desired power
	  state

if CLOCK_MGMT

module = CLOCK_MGMT
module-str = clock management
source "subsys/logging/Kconfig.template.log_config"

config CLOCK_MGMT_SET_RATE
	bool "Support runtime rate setting"
	select CLOCK_MGMT_RUNTIME
	help
	  Allow clock consumers to request a given clock frequency via the
	  clock management framework. The framework will then configure the
	  clock tree so that the consumer is supplied with the closest
	  possible frequency to its request. Note that enabling this feature
	  will result in increased flash utilization

config CLOCK_MGMT_RUNTIME
	bool "Support runtime clock rate requests"
	help
	  Support runtime clock rate requests. When enabled, clock producers
	  will track the clock requests from each consumer, and reject
	  conflicting requests. This Kconfig also enables registering
	  for clock rate change notifications

config CLOCK_MGMT_CLK_NAME
	bool "Store names of each clock"
	help
	  Store names of each clock node. Uses additional ROM space. If
	  clock framework debug logging is enabled, traces will be printed
	  as the clock tree is reconfigured.

config CLOCK_MGMT_FIXED_SOURCE
	bool "Fixed clock source driver"
	default y
	depends on DT_HAS_FIXED_CLOCK_ENABLED
	help
	  Fixed clock source driver, for non configurable clock sources

config CLOCK_MGMT_SOURCE
	bool "Clock source driver"
	default y
	depends on DT_HAS_CLOCK_SOURCE_ENABLED
	help
	  Clock source driver, for fixed clock sources that may be gated/ungated
